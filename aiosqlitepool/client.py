        Initializes the high-level connection pool manager.

        Args:
            connection_factory: An async callable that returns a new raw
                database connection.
            pool_size (int, optional): The maximum number of connections to keep
                in the pool. Defaults to 20.
            acquisition_timeout (int, optional): The maximum number of seconds to
                wait for a connection to become available before raising a
                timeout error. Defaults to 30.
            idle_timeout (int, optional): The maximum number of seconds that a
                connection can remain idle in the pool before being closed and
                replaced. This helps prevent issues with firewalls or database
                servers closing stale connections. Set this to a value lower
                than your database's idle timeout setting. Defaults to 86400.
